"""
The fields module provides a number of data structures and functions to represent continuous, spatially varying data.

All fields are subclasses of Field which provides abstract functions for sampling field values at physical locations.

The most commonly used field types are

* CenteredGrid embeds a tensor in the physical space. Uses linear interpolation between grid points.
* StaggeredGrid samples the vector components at face centers instead of at cell centers.
* Noise is a function that produces a procedurally generated noise field
