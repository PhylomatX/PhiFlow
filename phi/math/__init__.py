"""
Vectorized operations, tensors with named dimensions.

This package provides a common interface for tensor operations.
Is internally uses NumPy, TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Provides

* A tensor base class with multiple implementations
* A NumPy-like API for mathematical operations over tensors as well as tensor generation

The provided operations are not implemented directly.
Instead, they delegate the actual computation to either NumPy, TensorFlow or PyTorch, depending on the configuration.
This allows the user to write simulation code once and have it run with various computation backends.

Main classes:

* Tensor
* Shape

See the `phi.math` module documentation at https://tum-pbs.github.io/PhiFlow/Math.html
